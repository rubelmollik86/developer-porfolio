            <h3>Learn web-developing And create my first web-side</h3>


            <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript;
                dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a
                few
                hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

                I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
                direction. I
                do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools
                well
                suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the
                types of
                tools I’d prefer to be using.
