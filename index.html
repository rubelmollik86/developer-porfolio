            <h1><span class="orange-color">Md Rubel mollik</span> World!</h1>
            <h3>Learn web-developing And create my first web-side</h3>
        </div>

        <p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript;
            dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a
            few
            hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

            I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
            direction. I
            do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools
            well
            suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the
            types of
            tools I’d prefer to be using.</p>
